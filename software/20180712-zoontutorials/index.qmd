:::

The `zoon` R package [@golding2017] provides a modular framework for constructing reproducible species distribution modelling workflows. Each module is an interoperable snippet of code, which facilitates comparison and evaluation of different approaches.

The `zoontutorials` project created an series of vignettes to guide SDM best practices using `zoon`. Vignettes include:

-   Choosing A Modelling Method

-   Data exploration

-   Data Sources

-   Introduction to SDMs

-   Model Evaluation

-   Reproducibility

-   Selecting and preparing covariates

I helped to build this resource in my capacity as a Research Assistant. This work was supported by the R Consortium.
