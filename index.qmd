I'm a Research Fellow with [Nick Golding](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) in the [Infectious Disease Ecology and Modelling team](https://qaeco.com/) at [Telethon Kids Institute](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/), Perth, WA, Australia. I work remotely from sunny Brisbane on developing and operationalising statistical models for mapping and forecasting in public health. I am passionate about reproducible research, and enjoy teaching programming in R.
