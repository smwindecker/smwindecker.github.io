    "text": "mixchar manuscript  mixchar R package\n\nThe mixchar R package (Windecker et al. 2021) provides a method to estimating proportions of primary carbon types in plant material. Plant cell wall biomass is composed of a range of different types of carbon. Proportions of primary carbon types are useful for estimating kinetic decay parameters or for calculation of intrinsic plant traits. Traditional methods for calculation of these components involve wet chemistry methods that can be monetarily and environmentally costly. Thermogravimetric analysis is an alternative method, already in use in the biofuel field, that involves pyrolysing dry, ground plant litter and estimating components from resulting mass decay peaks. Since different carbon types break down relatively independently during different temperature phases, we can separate the multi-peaked rate of mass loss curve into constituent parts using a mixture model. mixchar conducts this peak separation analysis in a open-source and reproducible way using R. This methodology has been tested on a range of plant litter composed primarily of soluble carbohydrates, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin.\nI built this package as part of my PhD thesis at University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWindecker, Saras M., Peter A.

    "text": "zenodo release  gdaltools R package\n\nTo make all steps of a research pipeline reproducible, it is important to ensure that processing of spatial data is also recorded used transparent and reproducible code. Many functions that exist to process spatial data with reprojecting or rasterizing are much slower than using gdal from the terminal. However, writing in command language is not very familiar to many R users, so this wrapper package contains a few functions to call gdal directly, from within R."

Before that, I spent my PhD working on soil carbon storage in freshwater wetlands.\nI enjoy implementing reproducible research practices in my science, particularly in my code, which is reflected in my commitment to reproducible research, which you can check out on my GitHub. I also really enjoy teaching coding and stats, and do so regularly at our lab’s Coding Club, at a range of conferences, workshops, and presentations."
